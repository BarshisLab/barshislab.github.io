# Coral transcriptome data processing

### 2-year transplant of Porites astreoides 
- Puerto Morelos, Mexico
- from low pH ojo (submarine discharge spring) and high pH control site to low pH ojo and control site
- Ana Martinez (PhD candidate) & Adina Paytan (PI) & Dan Barshis (PI)

### Transplant design (information from Ana)
- Corals were taken from 3 different origins: within the ojo (center), outside the ojo (control) and in the reef.
- Corals were then fixed in 3 transplant sites: within the ojo (Ojo LAJA Center and Ojo NORTE Center) and in a control site (Ojo Laja CONTROL).
- From each colony, 3 replicates (or individual cores) were taken

### Analyzed by Veronica Radice, Barshis Lab, Old Dominion University
